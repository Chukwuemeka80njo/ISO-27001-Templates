# Procedures

This folder contains all operational procedures that support the implementation of ISO/IEC 27001:2022 controls and policies.  
Procedures describe **how** security activities must be carried out in practice — step-by-step, with roles, inputs, outputs, and records.

While policies define *what* must be done, procedures define *how to do it* consistently and correctly.
